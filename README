This is a port of the JQuery lightbox plugin, developed by Leandro Vieira Pinho. I have made a couple of modifications to it so far, including:

1. Changing the top position of the lightbox window

TODOS: 

1. Make the top property a configurable option.
2. Add callback hooks for setup and teardown.
3. Put together testing procedure.
4. Figure out minimizing procedure.
